# Danny's_Diner_SQL_Challenge



## 1. Background

Danny, a passionate lover of Japanese cuisine, decided to follow his dream and open a small restaurant named **Dannyâ€™s Diner** at the start of 2021. The diner serves his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, as the business grows, Danny finds himself in need of data-driven insights to help his restaurant thrive.

He has collected some basic customer data but needs assistance in analyzing it to understand his customers' behaviors, spending patterns, and preferences. By doing so, Danny hopes to create a more personalized experience for his diners and improve his customer loyalty program.

To achieve these goals, Danny has provided key datasets related to customer orders, menu items, and loyalty program members. Using this data, the aim is to answer several important business questions that will help Danny make strategic decisions for his restaurant.




## 2. Overview

This project is a part of the **8-Week SQL Challenge** and focuses on using **SQL** to analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns at Danny's Diner. The challenge involves using three datasets provided by Danny, which include **sales**, **menu**, and **members**.

Through the use of SQL queries, this project answers key questions such as:

1. **Total customer spending** at the diner.
   
2. **Frequency of customer visits**.
   
3. **First purchased item** for each customer.

4. **Most purchased menu item** overall and for each customer.

5. Customer behavior **before and after** joining the loyalty program.
   
6. **Points calculation** based on their spending, with multipliers for specific items and loyalty bonuses.

The data analysis will help Danny optimize his restaurant's loyalty program, understand customer preferences, and improve overall customer satisfaction.



## 3. Datasets Used:
**Sales**: Records of customer orders, including order date and menu items purchased.

**Menu**: Information about each menu item and its corresponding price.

**Members**: Data on when customers joined the restaurant's loyalty program.

## Tools and Skills:

SQL for querying relational databases.

Basic data manipulation and aggregation techniques.

Understanding of business metrics and customer behavior analysis.

Through this project, I used SQL queries to answer business-related questions and provide actionable insights for Danny's Diner. You can find the detailed analysis and queries in the files linked in this repository.




## 4. Executive Summary

This case study analyzes customer purchase behavior at a restaurant, focusing on understanding customer spending, popular menu items, and membership benefits. Using SQL queries, we extracted valuable insights from transactional data, determining how much customers spent, which items they bought, and the impact of loyalty program membership. Key findings include the total spending of each customer, the number of visits, and the most purchased menu items. Additionally, the analysis tracks how the loyalty program influenced customer behavior before and after joining, including points earned and membership-driven purchases.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of customer activity, enabling the restaurant to make data-driven decisions to improve customer engagement, loyalty program effectiveness, and menu offerings.




## 5. Insights Deep Dive

**- Customer Spending Patterns**: The total amount spent by each customer shows significant variability. Customer A, for instance, spent $228 across multiple visits, while Customer C only spent $108. Understanding these patterns can help the restaurant tailor offers based on customer behavior.

**- Visit Frequency**: Customer B visited the restaurant 6 times, while Customer C only visited twice. This highlights the importance of maintaining engagement with infrequent customers to increase retention.

**- Menu Item Preferences**: "Ramen" was the most popular menu item overall, with 24 orders across all customers. Ramen also emerged as a favorite for multiple customers, suggesting it could be leveraged as a lead product in promotions or special offers.

**- Pre- and Post-Membership Behavior**: Customers tend to purchase more or higher-value items after becoming members. For example, Customer A consistently ordered ramen after joining the loyalty program. Tracking such behavior helps evaluate the program's success and its impact on sales.

**- Points Accumulation**: Customer A accumulated 2,580 points through the loyalty program, with Customer B closely following at 2,820 points. Notably, sushi orders doubled the points, giving insight into which products can drive more engagement through rewards.

**- Membership Timing and First-Week Bonus**: Customer A earned 4,110 points by taking full advantage of the first-week bonus period, compared to Customer B, who accumulated fewer points due to fewer high-value orders during this time.



## 6. Recommendations

**1. Enhance Loyalty Program Engagement**: *The analysis shows increased purchases after customers join the membership program. To maximize this behavior, the restaurant should consider promoting its membership benefits more aggressively, offering targeted promotions for non-members to join, and providing personalized discounts to frequent members based on their favorite items*.

**2. Target Promotions for Popular Items**: *Since ramen and sushi are the most popular items, the restaurant could create limited-time offers or combo meals featuring these dishes. This would likely increase sales volume and customer satisfaction, particularly among frequent visitors*.

**3. Encourage Infrequent Customers**: *Customers like C, who visit less frequently, represent an opportunity for growth. The restaurant could implement targeted marketing campaigns that offer personalized discounts or incentives to bring them back more often, such as exclusive deals through the loyalty program*.

**4. Introduce Multi-Tier Rewards**: *The restaurant could consider multi-tiered rewards, where certain items (like ramen or sushi) offer a higher points multiplier or exclusive rewards to encourage more spending and engagement. This could also boost overall membership participation and increase average spend per visit*.

**5. Optimize Menu Pricing and Offers**: *Using insights from customer behavior, the restaurant could adjust pricing or create bundle offers that align with the most popular items like ramen. This would enhance the perceived value for customers and potentially increase sales from both regulars and newcomers*.
