# Danny's_Diner_SQL_Challenge

## Background

Danny, a passionate lover of Japanese cuisine, decided to follow his dream and open a small restaurant named **Dannyâ€™s Diner** at the start of 2021. The diner serves his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, as the business grows, Danny finds himself in need of data-driven insights to help his restaurant thrive.

He has collected some basic customer data but needs assistance in analyzing it to understand his customers' behaviors, spending patterns, and preferences. By doing so, Danny hopes to create a more personalized experience for his diners and improve his customer loyalty program.

To achieve these goals, Danny has provided key datasets related to customer orders, menu items, and loyalty program members. Using this data, the aim is to answer several important business questions that will help Danny make strategic decisions for his restaurant.

## Overview

This project is a part of the **8-Week SQL Challenge** and focuses on using **SQL** to analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns at Danny's Diner. The challenge involves using three datasets provided by Danny, which include **sales**, **menu**, and **members**.

Through the use of SQL queries, this project answers key questions such as:

1. **Total customer spending** at the diner.
   
2. **Frequency of customer visits**.
   
3. **First purchased item** for each customer.

4. **Most purchased menu item** overall and for each customer.

5. Customer behavior **before and after** joining the loyalty program.
   
6. **Points calculation** based on their spending, with multipliers for specific items and loyalty bonuses.

The data analysis will help Danny optimize his restaurant's loyalty program, understand customer preferences, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Datasets Used:
**Sales**: Records of customer orders, including order date and menu items purchased.

**Menu**: Information about each menu item and its corresponding price.

**Members**: Data on when customers joined the restaurant's loyalty program.
